# Örder self-checker
Örder is not only an awesome order management application, it is also a great self-evaluation, done by our best junior java developers.
The goal is not to "get it over with", the goal is to learn & grow:
 - Do I grasp the concepts?
 - Which topics do I get? Where can I challenge myself to go the extra mile?
 - Where do I struggle? Which topics should I work on?
 - Do codereviews on your own code. Make it work + improve and refine it. (for inspiration, look at https://switchfully.slack.com/files/UK99TQ0G6/F0100872XJA/codereview.pdf)
## Which choices did you make in your project
As a developer you have to make choices constantly.
Choices about time efficiency and quality, choices about your architecture, choices about functionality.
Which choices did you make? (List your choices below, remove what is not relevant)
 - What is your focus when working on Örder?
 > ....
 - Do you have a single-module maven project? Or a multi-module maven project?
 > ....
 - Are you working test-first?
 > ....
 - Do you have security enabled?
 > ....
 - Do you have logging enabled?
 > ....
 - What happens if the firstname contains numbers? Is this allowed?
 > ....
 - In which currency are the prices?
 > ....
 - Does the phonenumber include the country code?
 > ....
 - Did you go for a similar architecture as digibooky?
 > ....
 - Is your application deployed in the cloud? (Heroku?)
 > ....
 - ....
